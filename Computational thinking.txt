Computational thinking techniques
1. Decomposition: breaking down problems into smaller tasks.
2. Pattern recognition/Generalization :
3. Abstraction: simplifying problem by focusing on important parts.
4. Algorithms: Set of steps set for a program to follow.
5. Logical Reasoning
6.Evaluation:Checking if the program works as intended or needs to be improved.
